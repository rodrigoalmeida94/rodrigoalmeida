During my MSc programme in the integration course called Academic Consultancy Training, me and my team where asked to create a Digital Earth application using the available tools provided by the university. We traveled to Groenlo, in the eastern part of the Netherlands to a farm house in a predominantly agriculture area to gather data for that application. One of the issues currently debated in academia and in the ag-tech space is what are the best tools to be used to gather information on crop growth and development by farmers. Knowing the interest and questions that arise surrounding drone use we set out to assess if it was beneficial for the farmers in Groenlo, that have mostly grassland fields, to use high resolution drone imagery in their day to day operations.

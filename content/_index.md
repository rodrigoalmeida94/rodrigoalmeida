Hi there!

I am a **Geo-Information, AI and Cloud Engineer**. 🛰️ 🌍 🤖

{{< figure class="avatar" src="./avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I enjoy working on hard things that matter to everyone and I like to work with people that care deeply about what they do. 

Satellite imagery and geo-information broadly has an incredible potential impact on increasing transparency, efficiency and development all across the world, as long and we do it right. I intend to help make it rigth. 

Here is a brief overview of my professsional experience, my education background and also some non-profits I've worked with over the years. 

If you have any questions or remarks feel free to reach out - I am always happy to chat!

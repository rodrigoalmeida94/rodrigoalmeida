### Project Overview
This research investigates the predictive skill of state-of-the-art deterministic AI weather models for extreme events through the lens of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). By applying input perturbations—varying from Gaussian noise to Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors and Huge Ensembles—we evaluate how these data-driven models respond and whether they can provide reliable probabilistic forecasts for rare, high-impact events like the 2022 Pakistan floods.

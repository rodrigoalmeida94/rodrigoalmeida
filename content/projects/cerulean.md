### Project Overview
Developed a multi-cloud (AWS and GCP) and cost-efficient cloud infrastructure for running deep learning-based oil spill detection with Sentinel-1 images. This system processes the entire archive and automatically monitors newly available scenes.

### Technical Details
- **Infrastructure**: Leveraged both AWS and GCP for a resilient and cost-effective multi-cloud setup.
- **Data Processing**: Sentinel-1 SAR imagery processing at scale.
- **Deep Learning**: Integrated deep learning models for automated detection of oil slicks.
- **Automation**: Fully automated pipelines for newly available satellite imagery.

### Project Overview
This research investigated the potential use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with electronic noses (gas sensors) to estimate the maturity of apples (*Malus domestica*) directly in the orchard. The goal was to provide a non-destructive and automated way to determine the optimal harvest time.

### Technical Details
- **Hardware**: Integration of electronic noses (MOS sensors) with UAV platforms.
- **Sensors**: Detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like ethylene, which are indicators of fruit ripeness.
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to correlate sensor readings with traditional maturity indices.
- **Field Study**: Conducted at Wageningen University and Research (WUR) experimental orchards.

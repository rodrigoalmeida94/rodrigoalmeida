### Project Overview

At Jua.ai, I worked on building a foundational AI model for the natural world. This involved managing massive geospatial datasets and creating high-resolution weather forecasting pipelines.

### Key Contributions

- **Data Engineering**: Managed the ingestion of over 30 different sources of historical weather observation data into a common data warehouse (> 500 TB), leveraging **Zarr** and **Parquet** for efficient storage and access.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Built and maintained live ETL pipelines for weather data using **Prefect** and deployed on **GCP** and **AWS**.
- **Model Downscaling**: Developed a deep learning pipeline using **Zarr** and **Dask** to downscale global weather forecasts to 1x1 km resolution, running 4 times daily.
- **Leadership**: Led a team of 2 engineers, bridging the gap between technical implementation and product requirements.
